// Given a Binary Tree, find diameter of it.
// The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree.
// The diagram below shows two trees each with diameter nine, the leaves that form the ends of a longest
// path are shaded (note that there is more than one path in each tree of length nine, but no path longer than nine nodes).
